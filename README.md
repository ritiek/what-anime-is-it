# what-anime-is-it

Predicts anime from a video file or image.

This simple bash script uses http://whatanime.ga/ ([GitHub source](https://github.com/soruly/whatanime.ga)) to fetch the anime name.

## Installation & usage

```
git clone https://github.com/ritiek/what-anime-is-it
cd what anime-is-it
bash predict.sh </path/to/image/or/video>
```

If you are predicting from a video file, you'll need have `ffmpeg` installed.
